            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a Nashville native. I have spent most of my vocational career in warehouse
                    management,
                    distribution, and transportation and logistics. I currently work as delivery truck driver for a
                    company
                    contracted
                    to deliver Publix groceries.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p2>
                    I would like to transition into a career that allows me to be more creative and foster
                    my critital
                    thinking and problem solving abilities. Thus I'm attending an online boot came offered by Vanderbilt
                    University in hopes of obtaining a certificate in full-stackk web development.
